# Boss.AI-Training-Tools
Boss.AI Training Tools is a set of tools that can be used to mod or train Boss

As of 4/12/2020 the Boss.AI Training Toolkit has 1 tool.

This tool is the conversation.bat / conversation.sh tool and it is useful if you want to suggest changes to Boss Chatbot or make a modification to the conversation based learning. It asks for what the user should say, then what Boss should say. It then outputs a fake chat log based off Discord's chat logging and that file can be placed in the AI training repo before training to add that conversation to training.
